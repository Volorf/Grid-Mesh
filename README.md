# Procedural Grid Mesh
Create a mesh based grid for your cool Unity 3D project.


![Grid Mesh Demo 1](/Images/gridMeshUnityInspector.png)

## Three simple steps
1. [Download `GridMesh.cs`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Volorf/Hover3D.js/master/hover3D.js);
2. Add `GridMesh` component to a GameObject;
3. Set it up.

## How to set up it via Inspector
**`X Segments`** defines how many cell you will get on the X axis.
**`Y Segments`** defines how many cell you will get on the Y axis.

**`X Step`** defines a cell width.

**`Y Step`** defines a cell height.
**`Mat`** allows you to set up a material.
**`Centered`** Centers grid to the center of the game object

## How to set up it via Code
You have a bunch of properties you can tweak to control the effect.
```csharp
public Material gridMat;
private GridMesh _gridMesh;

private void Awake() 
{
    _gridMesh = GetComponent<GridMesh>();
}

private void Start()
{
    // How many cell you will get on the X axis
    _gridMesh.xSegments = 16;
    // How many cell you will get on the Y axis
    _gridMesh.ySegments = 16;
    // Cell width
    _gridMesh.xStep = 0.5f;
    // Cell height
    _gridMesh.yStep = 0.5f;
    // Set a material. By default it's magenta
    _gridMesh.material = gridMat;
    // Center grid to the game object
    _gridMesh.centered = false;
}
```

## Good to know
Right know you can't change the thickness of the grid lines and it's rendered as an 1px line. But, I hope I will add it in the next update.
